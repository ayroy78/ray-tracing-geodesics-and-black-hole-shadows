Hi, welcome to the ray tracing and black hole repository.

There are 5 main types of routines. Below are the divisions and which files are used for which routines. In all cases, the C++ file is used for ray integration, and the python files are used for plotting.

1. Single Particle/Photon Schwarzschild Tracing

files:

schwarz_particle.cpp
schwarz_photon.cpp
schwarz_analytical_single_diagrams.py

2. Single Particle/Photon Kerr Tracing

files:

kerr_analytical_particle.cpp
kerr_analytical_photon.cpp
kerr_analytical_single_diagrams.py

3. Analytical Kerr Shadows

files:

kerr_analytical_shadow.cpp
kerr_analytical_shadow.py

4. Spline Kerr Shadows

This makes its own data and interpolates it.

files:

kerr_spline_shadow.cpp
kerr_spline_shadow.py

5. Modified Kerr Shadows

files:

modified_kerr_shadow_fast.cpp
modified_kerr_shadow.py
kerr_rh=0.0359508947168857_omh=0.956.txt

The last is a data file, made by Dr. Lucas Collodel for the cloud case/zero scalar hair case, with accuracy on the order of 10^-4-10^-3.

The columns are arranged as x,th,f0,f1,f2,w. x is the compactified radial coordinate. There are 120 x values for every one of the 30 theta values.

The format is similar to the files produced by Cunha et al. on their website http://gravitation.web.ua.pt/node/416 

Note that they order the values differently and use a different line element. For them, w = Wr.
